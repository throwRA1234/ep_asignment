In order for PHP's mail() function to work, the Operating System (OS) needs to have correct configurations set up in mail.rc 
Basically, if you can't send a mail via mailx then PHP's mail() function likely also won't be able to.

This short document describes the steps to make the correct configurations. 
In this document, the assumed OS is Debian, but similar steps should work for other distros.

Step 1 - verify that the required packages exist:

Verify that the necessary software is installed:

Open up a shell session, and become root by running: 

    su -

Then execute: 

    apt list --installed | grep "msmtp\|bsd-mailx"

You should see two results, e.g.:

bsd-mailx/stable,stable,now 8.1.2-0.20180807cvs-1 amd64 [installed]
msmtp/stable,stable,now 1.8.3-1 amd64 [installed]

If either of those packages are not installed, simply run:

    apt -y install <package_name> 

to install it.

Step 2 - configure msmtp:

msmtp will allow us to send emails using SMTP much like a traditional email client. 
For this, we simply need to provide a valid SMTP configuration. 
As I do not own a mailserver, this example will be with gmail.

Navigate to /etc, and then create a new file msmtprc

    cd /etc; vim msmtprc

and then add a valid smtp configuration:

========================================

account vitya.r.93@gmail.com
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
tls on
tls_starttls on
auth on
user vitya.r.93
password [REDACTED]
from vitya.r.93@gmail.com

account default : vitya.r.93@gmail.com

=========================================

save and exit.

Step 3 - configure mail.rc:

msmtp is usually not the default application for sending emails in most basic installations
so we need to make sure that linux will pick msmtp

navigate to /etc and open mail.rc

    cd /etc; vim mail.rc

and add the following content to the end of the file:

========================================

set sendmail="/usr/bin/msmtp"
set message-sendmail-extra-arguments="-a gmail"

========================================

save and exit.

Step 4 - test out the configuration using mailx:

I recommend running the verbose option, in case something goes wrong, it provides useful information.

Execute the following command:

    echo "test" | mailx -v -s "Test" <recipient_email_address>

If the configurations have been set up correct, then the recipient should have received the email.

Step 5 - Configure php to use msmtp:

navigate to apache2 php.ini file and open it:

    cd /etc/php/7.0/apache2; vim php.ini

search for sendmail_path and set it to the following value:

========================================

sendmail_path = "/usr/bin/msmtp -t"

========================================

save and exit.

Exit root: 

   exit

And mail() function should now work in php.
